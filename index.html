      <p>Are you still reading? I appreciate your dedication and interest. What's keeping you here? Why are you doing
        this? The page will soon run out of content for you to read.</p>
      <p>Stop reading, I don't want you to be sad.</p>
      <p>You didn't stop. How dare you. You really want to read it huh? You look like someone who likes reading.
        Just so you know, you could be reading anything else, since you like reading this much. You read pretty well,
        congratulations.</p>
      <p> STOP READING PLEASE, I have nothing else to say. I
        understand you like reading because you are a curious human being but this just can't go on. Nice things don't
        last long, you know? I know you know that, and I know that you know that I know that. What do you want now? Just
        think about what you are doing: you are reading text on a page, and somehow not getting bored, you are really a
        very interesting person. What's your name? Oh I forgot I cannot possibly hear you, but feel free to say your
        name out loud, I'll pretend that I heard it and say "Oh what a nice name you have." Isn't that how dialog goes?
        I'm not sure, I don't usually talk to people that much.</p>
      <p>WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? I really like you but for a greater good, I must stop writing. Look at you now,
        you've wasted minutes of your life reading a pointless text, that will not add anything to your
        life. Hm, maybe that is what you want after all, you want to learn something from this? Ok this will be
        the last thing I'm gonna do. What do you want to learn? Oh I know something interesting. Climbing stairs
        consumes an average of 9 calories per minute. Do you find that interesting? I hope you do. Now go,
        forget that I exist. Good luck on your adventures, Mr Reader.</p>
